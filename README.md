The invention uses data generated by vibration sensors (known as
MEMS accelerometers) within computer hard disk drives to quickly
analyze and assess information generated by seismic events. This
technique is enabled by collecting hard drive sensor data and
transmitting it via high speed networking to a data processing center,
which can analyze the data, classify the events, and enrich the dataâ€“in real time.
